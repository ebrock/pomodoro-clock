# Pomodoro Clock

Pomodoro Clock is a React App study tool, designed and coded from scratch by me.

Final product [here](https://ericbrock.net/projects/5/public/index.html).

## Description
The pomodoro clock is a timer with two countdowns, session and break. You do work during the session countdown, and you take a break during the break countdown. 

As a rule of thumb the session timer should always be longer than the break. It is traditionally a 25 minute session timer and a 5 minute break timer. 

This project is part of freeCodeCamp.org's curriculum, found here: [Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Pomodoro Clock](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock).

## Usage
Click the "+" and "-" to increase and decrease time, respectively. After you decide on your limits, click the PLAY button. An alarm will play at the end of each countdown during a 3 second transition period. Then the next countdown begins. 

You can pause the timer whenever you want. If you want to reset the values, simply click the reset button on the right side.
